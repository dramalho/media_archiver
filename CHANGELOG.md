# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. 

This file was created recently as I didn't document previous changes correctly. I'll try to backport stuff and as I do I'll remove this warning, but in the meantime I'm keeping this for context.
Also, this process is new to me in terms of taking charge of writting it so I'll make all the necessary newbie mistakes, don't bear with me, point them out!

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
